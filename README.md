# Internship at GrowYT

## The Cornerstones of a Software Engineer Internship Framework

There are four major elements in the core area of structuring a successful internship program in software development.

* **Goal setting**: helps the supervisor plan the assignments and provide the intern with valuable experience;
* **Mentorship**: motivates and empowers interns to identify their own challenges in the development process and get insightful feedback every step of the way;
* **Training**: helps your interns put their newly acquired knowledge into practice and expand their technical skills;
* **Professional Development**: the goal of an internship program is to produce competent and skilled developers that ideally would turn into full-time employees;

## Quick checklist:
 
* Assess the level of the intern and make a tailored program for his/her level of experience to optimize the learning curve;
* Make a diverse program that covers multiple aspects of engineering, not only the coding part.
* For example: include DevOps, agile best practices, databases, etc;
* Provide the intern with courses but don’t leave them to just repeat the coding exercise from the courses; challenge them to solve similar problems apart from the course and do coding on their own;
* Provide constant & constructive feedback, and don’t stick only to pull request feedback. Try to read between the lines as the interns are shy and mostly won’t express their fears and need of assistance;
* Write the feedback every week to easily track the progress and make a plan for the entire internship. Include a checklist of skills for every week/month.
* Ask them to do demos of their work in front of a bigger audience as much as possible. Being technically fluent is equally important as being a good coder.
* Teach them how to think when they need to provide an estimate; let them do estimations for small user stories by breaking the user story into tasks so they can learn the thinking process and engineering behind it.
* Don’t forget to teach them about the definition of done and unit testing. Quality code is very important!

## Have Fun
Interns are just beginning their long careers in software engineering. While most are driven to work hard and prove themselves, the thought of working long hours in an office devoid of fun isn't going to convince them to return. Lob's company-wide bonding events, like game nights, escape rooms, and sporting events, increase in frequency during our internship programs. These events are beneficial in building trust and empathy among the team.

**Takeaway**: Push interns to work hard and show grit, but don't forget to have fun.
